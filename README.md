# Personal Bio Site

## Description
This project exists to showcase my developer portfolio and projects I have worked on during the course of learning to code. 

The project features vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but also makes use of Bootstrap grid system and a carousel functionality for cycling through projects I've completed. The content for the carousel is printed to the DOM from a projects array in main.js and I am using a print to DOM function and projects builder function to push available projects into the carousel code.
